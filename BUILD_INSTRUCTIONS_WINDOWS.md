## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Visual Studio not found"
- **Solution**: Install Visual Studio 2022 with C++ development tools
- **Download**: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

#### "Windows SDK not found" 
- **Solution**: Install Windows 10/11 SDK through Visual Studio Installer
- **Steps**: Visual Studio Installer → Modify → Individual Components → Windows 10/11 SDK

#### "LNK2019: unresolved external symbol"
- **Solution**: Missing library links - ensure all required .lib files are linked
- **Check**: The project file includes all necessary libraries

#### "C2039: identifier not found"
- **Solution**: Missing includes or wrong Windows version targeting
- **Fix**: Ensure Windows 10/11 SDK is properly installed

#### Compilation Warnings
- **Unicode warnings**: These are normal and don't affect functionality
- **C4566 emoji warnings**: Fixed in latest version (emojis removed)

### Performance Tips
- **Use Release build** for final executables (much faster)
- **Use x64 platform** for better performance on modern systems
- **Disable antivirus** temporarily during compilation if it's blocking
