## Obfuscation Techniques Documented

### 1. Multi-Layer Encoding
```
Original Code → gzdeflate → ROT13 → Base64 → eval()
```

### 2. Dynamic Function Construction
```php
$charArray = urldecode('%66%67%36%73%62%65%68%70%72%61%34%63%6f%5f%74%6e%64');
// Builds function names from character indices
```

### 3. File Disguise
- GIF header spoofing
- MIME type manipulation
- Binary data embedding

- Error suppression
- User-Agent filtering
- Session-based authentication
- Function availability checking
