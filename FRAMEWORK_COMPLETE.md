### **5. Wordlist Integration**
- ✅ **Admin/User Column Wordlists** - From `column_admin.txt`
  - 26 common administrative column names
  - User authentication table detection
  - Member and moderator account enumeration

- ✅ **Order/Payment Column Wordlists** - From `column_order.txt`
  - 12 financial table and column names
  - Credit card and payment information detection
  - Transaction and billing data enumeration

### **6. Advanced HTTP Client**
- ✅ Cross-platform HTTP/HTTPS support (Windows/Linux)
- ✅ Custom User-Agent rotation for stealth
- ✅ Cookie management and session handling
- ✅ Proxy support and traffic routing
- ✅ Request/response logging and debugging

### **7. Stealth and Evasion**

- **JSON**: Custom lightweight JSON parsing
- **Cross-platform**: Conditional compilation for Windows/Linux

### **Performance Features**
- Multithreaded scanning for improved speed
- Efficient memory management with RAII
- Optimized string operations and regex matching
- Configurable timeout and retry mechanisms
- Resource pooling for HTTP connections

### **Security Features**
- Input validation and sanitization
